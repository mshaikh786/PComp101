This code solves for steady state heat transfer in a  metal plate 
modelled by 2D Laplace equation.

The serial, OpenMP and MPI verisons of the code are included


BUILD:
Makefiles to build on CrayXC and with OpenMPI on a white cluster are provided in src directories.
There is a global Makefile which build everything on a CrayXC
> make all
To build with visualisation support 
> make VIS=1 all
The resulting exeuctables should end up in "bin" directory. 


RUN:

srun -n NUM_MPI_TASKS -c NUM_OMP_THREADS heat_VERSION [options]

options:
	-r 	Number of points in Y dimension
	-c 	Number of points in X dimension
	-d	Tolerace value for change in tempearture used as stop condition, default is 1.0e-4 
	-m	Maximum iterations in case tolerance is not reached, default is 4000
	-k	Checkpoint results on every kth iteration, default is 1000
	-t 	Maximum temprature to be set at the boundaries. Default is 100.0
		The inner domain will have Max_temp*0.75.

The default problem size is set to 2046 x 2046 grid points but can be increased using 
-r and -c parameters as command line arguments. This will increase the heap allocation by the code.
Default iterations are set to 1000 but can be modified using -m command line argument.
